[8 kyu - Power]

The goal is to create a function of two inputs number and power, that "raises" the number up to power (ie multiplies number by itself power times).
Examples

numberToPower(3, 2)  // -> 9 ( = 3 * 3 )
numberToPower(2, 3)  // -> 8 ( = 2 * 2 * 2 )
numberToPower(10, 6) // -> 1000000

Note: Math.pow and some other Math functions like eval() and ** are disabled.
